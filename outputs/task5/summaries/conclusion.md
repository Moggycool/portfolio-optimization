## Conclusion (Backtest: monthly)

Over the backtest window, the strategy **outperformed** the 60/40 benchmark on total return (19.61% vs 14.92%). The strategy’s Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown provide additional context for risk-adjusted performance and downside risk.

Limitations: this is a simplified backtest using daily returns with (optional) stylized rebalancing and no/slim transaction costs. It does not model slippage, bid–ask spreads, taxes, or realistic execution timing. Results are sensitive to the chosen backtest window and to estimation error in expected returns and covariances (especially with a forecast-based view on TSLA). A more robust evaluation would include multiple windows, transaction-cost sensitivity, and stress/regime analysis.
