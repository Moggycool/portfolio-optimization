## Trend Analysis (12m)

The central forecast (median/p50) indicates an **upward** trend over the forecast window, with an estimated change of **35.23%** from start to end. This summarizes the expected direction under the model’s central scenario.

However, TSLA forecasts should be interpreted primarily through the uncertainty bands. The widening prediction interval over time indicates that confidence in specific long-horizon price levels diminishes substantially.
