## Market Opportunities
- Central forecast trend is **upward** (p50 change ≈ 35.23% over horizon).
- Potential opportunity: gradual upside scenario supports phased entry / rebalancing toward TSLA within risk limits.

## Market Risks
- Uncertainty widens materially with horizon (band width end/start ratio ≈ 25.22×).
- High forecast uncertainty implies long-horizon point forecasts should not be treated as precise targets.
- Wide bands indicate substantial tail-risk; use scenarios for VaR/stress testing and set position limits accordingly.
