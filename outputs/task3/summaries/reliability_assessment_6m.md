## Forecast Reliability Assessment (6m)

For the 6m forecast, the prediction band widens as the horizon increases (e.g., width ≈ 242.80 at ~1 month vs ≈ 729.22 at the end). This widening reflects compounding uncertainty when forecasting volatile assets like TSLA. Short horizons are generally more actionable (tighter bands), while 6–12 month forecasts should be interpreted as broad scenario ranges rather than precise price targets.
